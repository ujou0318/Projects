Group #17 The Tuxeditors

Simon Pan 4
	I feel like.. I did reasonable amount of work but I am always late to meetings..
	and especially because I am international students, Understanding context require
	more time than other team members, so when there was a discussion in the group, I
	usually did not express myself at first but listen. To be honest, I feel like I am
	dragging the team down.. Originally I almost gave myself a 3 instead of 4, but I also
	think I tried to help as much and I didn't give away any bad attitude. I am welling
	to help whenever I can.. I am not the best team member but I am welling to learn..
