Group #17 The Tuxeditors

Simon Pan 5
	When I participate the meetings, I came up ideas that's very useful that other teammates didn't think of.
	Such as using the level editor in game to test our feature. I handed in my part of presentation and reports
	early so I think I deserve a 5 in general.
	
Andrew Lazenka 6
	Andrew volunteered for modifying the code and properly implmented the feature all by himself. Without him, 
	I don't think we can not figure out team issues. He contributes a lot in team work, very nice person.  
	
Noam McGregor 5
	Noam participates every meeting on time and conclude a lot of stuffs happened during discussion, and combie
	those results as lesson learned. Even though he's very busy at the end of semester but he still spend a lot
	of time with us to make sure everything goes well.
	
Renee Rosario 5
	At the end of the semester she seems really busy but she will stay up and modify the whole presentation and
	report as usual. She's helps me out on parts of presentation that I don't really confidant at; which helps
	me improve a lot.
	
Rory Bell 5
	He's always chill and bring up topics that changes the atomosphere of the group so people are less serious
	and less stress. He really helps the team to move on.

Hyun Heo 6
	As usual, he covers parts that seems the most complicated and most important ones, he also made sure every
	team members cover parts that are necessary to mention in the group. He doesn't complain in front of us in
	our team. He helped me a lot and to be honest I would not make this far without him. I am pretty sure I brought
	a lot of troubles to him since I always asked him questions. Really appreicate that he helps me this whole semester.
